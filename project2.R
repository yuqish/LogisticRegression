# This is where your GLM data is read form Cancellation.csv into a table in R
# Note that the folder in which you have Cancellation.csv must be set as the working directory

######################### Section 2: Create groups & aggregate data #########################

# Now you need to modify your data so that you can perform a GLM analysis

# First, any continuous variable needs to be grouped into discrete groups
# The code below groups the variable Number of Persons, from you table glmdata, into six groups, and stores this in a new column, NoPGroup
# It also groups the variable Activity into three groups.


###### This is only an example. You need to create your own groups, with breaks that suit your data
###### For example visualize the data for the different variables and refer to the information in the Appendix group the Activity codes on similar types of business.
###### Remember to think about risk homogeneous and stable groups, for example having groups with zero # of claims or claims cost and almost no Duration makes it hard to determine its risk.
###### You might also want to group other variables from glmdata, in a similar manner

# In other words, the code takes the GLM coefficients for the six NoP groups and saves those in glmdata3, in the rows corresponding to those groups.

######################### Section 5: Leveling #########################

#Here is a simple example on how you can estimate the base factor for step 2.
#The base factor relies heavily on how you estimate the expected claim cost for next year
#In this example we choose the simplest possible method and predicts it should be the same as last year

###### However it is always important to look into the data and analyze if there are any outliers or other strange outcomes that you need to consider.
############ Do you think 2021 will be similar to 2020, and how similar?
############ How much should older years affect?
############ Are there any trends over the years?

### Here are some additional metrics to determine expected claim cost

# Claims_Per_Year$ClaimCostperDuration = Claims_Per_Year$ClaimCost / Claims_Per_Year$Duration
# Claims_Per_Year$NumOfClaimsperDuration = Claims_Per_Year$NumberOfClaims / Claims_Per_Year$Duration

Expected_ClaimCost = Claims_Per_Year$ClaimCost[Claims_Per_Year$Category==2020]

Ratio = 0.9

Expected_Premium = Expected_ClaimCost/Ratio


### Estimate total risk for all the active policies

#Now we have an example of calculating the total risk for policies in 2020.
#This is also the most simple method to just choose risk factor based on the group
#If you want to further differentiate within groups you can try to make the risk factor continuous for numerical variables
#For example so that if you a group for 15-50 NoP, then it might be an idea to have different risks if the value is 15 or 50.

#Choose only those policies that are active
Active = subset(glmdata, glmdata$RiskYear == 2020)
